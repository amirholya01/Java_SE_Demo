# ![Java](java-logo-1.png) Phonebook Demo
It's a sample of a phonebook that made by Java (console application).
Users can save names and phone numbers and also show all phonebook info.
It contains a contact class and a main class.
I tried to use OOP in this small console application.

## Key Features:

- **Add new user**: Users and Admins can easily upload their videos to the platform.
- **Show all users**: Users can download videos uploaded by others.
